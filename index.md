# Arthur Chang's Portofolio

I am a Statistics and Probability Major at CSUF and I plan on graduating 2026.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

*Lab 5 Part 1: 

    This lab introduced the usage of functions in order to make the code in the main function easier to read. I found this lab useful in understanding what a function file did the way it could be used to better code the main function and how to call functions in general which would prove invaluable for future labs. I like how clean the code can look when not cluttered by functions which may be needed to be called many times.


*Lab 8 Part 1:

    This lab introduced the usage of taking inputs from a command line and as a vector and using them in order to parse through a function without a cin thing. This set up the basis for working with the command line while although difficult, and Iâ€™m still working through how to do it effectively, I think is very important. I like how much the main was shown as just a vector for understanding and how easy the trace was, if it werent the command line would have felt much harder to approach.


*Lab 7 Part 1:

    Parking had a lot of usage of the if operator and using if to breakdown the situation into cases. I found this set the basis for understanding checks in ifs, returning error messages since there were many opportunities for such here and for needing to really understand what the functions in a function do so that they can work with each other and more effectively the main. I really like how I was able to see each of the different situations that parking could contain and how their variation provided oppurtunities to try out different techniques in using if.
